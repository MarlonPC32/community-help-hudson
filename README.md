LatiHudson Project

This is a bilingual digital resource I designed to help residents of Hudson County, NJ, especially immigrants and underserved communities, easily locate free food assistance, shelters, legal aid, and healthcare services.

Built using Google Sites and Google My Maps, this tool simplifies access to critical local services by offering information in both English and Spanish. The project includes an interactive map, categorized listings, and a basic button-based chatbot to assist users with common questions.
